        I am a  MERN stack software developer. I am always curious about this technology world and wanted to learn about it. I have been a home maker for last almost 20 years taking care of my family and supporting my husband and my children in their educational, professional, and personal development along with volunteer work and working for non-profit organization. I would like to start my career in this field, I am ready to work hard and keep on learning every bit of moment. I believe in teamwork and integrity. 
    In my free time I do painting,sewing and henna tattoo. I would love to be being outdoor, we usually go for hiking and picnic with my family.
